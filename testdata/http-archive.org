* Test data for the ~bazel-insert-http-archive~ test

** Contents of the test repository archive

We add a few quirks to the =WORKSPACE= file to ensure that the workspace name is
correctly determined.

#+begin_src bazel-workspace :tangle prefix/WORKSPACE :mkdirp yes
"""
workspace(name = "haha")
"""

# workspace(name = "haha")

workspace(foo = 'name = "no",', name = "test_repository")

# workspace(name = "haha")
#+end_src

#+begin_src bazel-build :tangle prefix/BUILD :mkdirp yes
# Empty BUILD file
#+end_src

** Expected ~http_workspace~ snippet

The ~bazel-insert-http-archive~ test fakes a date of 2019-05-02.

#+begin_src bazel-workspace :tangle WORKSPACE.expected
http_archive(
    name = "test_repository",
    sha256 = "%sha256%",
    strip_prefix = "prefix/",
    urls = [
        "%url%",  # 2019-05-02
    ],
)
#+end_src
