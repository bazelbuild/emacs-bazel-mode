;;; Commentary:

;; This library contains a few utility functions to work with Bazel workspaces.

;;; Code:

(require 'cl-lib)

(defun bazel-util-workspace-root (file-name)
  "Find the root of the Bazel workspace containing FILE-NAME.
If FILE-NAME is not in a Bazel workspace, return nil."
  (locate-dominating-file file-name "WORKSPACE"))

(defun bazel-util-package-name (file-name workspace-root)
  "Return the nearest Bazel package for FILE-NAME under WORKSPACE-ROOT.
If FILE-NAME is not in a Bazel package, return nil."
  (let ((build-file-directory
         (cl-some (lambda (build-name)
                    (locate-dominating-file file-name build-name))
                  '("BUILD.bazel" "BUILD"))))
    (cond ((not build-file-directory) nil)
          ((file-equal-p workspace-root build-file-directory) "")
          ((file-in-directory-p build-file-directory workspace-root)
           (let ((package-name
                  (file-relative-name build-file-directory workspace-root)))
             ;; Only return package-name if we can confirm it is the local
             ;; relative file name of a BUILD file.
             (and package-name
                  (not (file-remote-p package-name))
                  (not (file-name-absolute-p package-name))
                  (directory-file-name package-name))))
          (t nil))))

(provide 'bazel-util)
