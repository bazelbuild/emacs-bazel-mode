Bazel Mode
==========

Bazel Mode is a GNU Emacs major mode for editing Bazel BUILD, WORKSPACE, and
bzl files, which are written in the Skylark language.

To use Bazel Mode, add the following to your .emacs file after replacing
"/path/to/bazel-mode/directory" with location where you installed Bazel Mode.

    (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/bazel-mode/directory")
    (autoload 'bazel-mode "bazel-mode" "Major mode for Bazel BUILD files." t)
    (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("/BUILD\\(\\..*\\)?\\'" . bazel-mode))
    (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("/WORKSPACE\\'" . bazel-mode))
    (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.bzl\\'" . bazel-mode))

Bazel Mode supports reformatting BUILD files with buildifier.  To use this
feature, you'll need to download and install buildifier, which is part of
Google's buildtools package:

    git clone https://github.com/bazelbuild/buildtools.git
    cd buildtools
    bazel build //buildifier

and then install buildifier in some directory that's in your PATH shell
environment variable.

Once buildifier is installed, you can use it in two different ways.  First,
Bazel Mode supports reformatting BUILD buffers by running bazel-format, which
is bound to the key sequence C-c C-f.  Additionally, you can configure Emacs to
automatically format BUILD and BUILD.bazel files with buildifier before saving
them by adding the following to your .emacs file:

    (add-hook 'bazel-mode-hook
              (lambda ()
                (when (search "BUILD" (file-name-nondirectory (buffer-file-name)))
                  (add-hook 'before-save-hook #'bazel-format nil t))))
