;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides support for the Bazel build system.  See
;; https://bazel.build/ for background on Bazel.
;;
;; The package provides four major modes for editing Bazel-related files:
;; ‘bazel-build-mode’ for BUILD files, ‘bazel-workspace-mode’ for WORKSPACE
;; files, ‘bazelrc-mode’ for .bazelrc configuration files, and
;; ‘bazel-starlark-mode’ for extension files written in the Starlark language.
;; These modes also extend Imenu and ‘find-file-at-point’ to support
;; Bazel-specific syntax.
;;
;; If Buildifier is available, the ‘bazel-mode-flymake’ backend for Flymake
;; provides on-the-fly syntax checking for Bazel files.  You can also run
;; Buildifier manually using the ‘bazel-buildifier’ command to reformat a Bazel
;; file buffer.
;;
;; The Bazel modes integrate with Xref to provide basic functionality to jump to
;; the definition of Bazel targets.
;;
;; To simplify running Bazel commands, the package provides the commands
;; ‘bazel-build’, ‘bazel-test’, ‘bazel-coverage’ and ‘bazel-run’, which execute
;; the corresponding Bazel commands in a compilation mode buffer.  In a buffer
;; that visits a test file, you can also have Emacs try to detect and execute
;; the test at point using ‘bazel-test-at-point’.
;;
;; When editing a WORKSPACE file, you can use the command
;; ‘bazel-insert-http-archive’ to quickly insert an http_archive rule.
;;
;; You can customize some aspects of this package using the ‘bazel’
;; customization group.  If you set the user option ‘bazel-display-coverage’ to
;; a non-nil value and then run ‘bazel coverage’ (either using the ‘compile’ or
;; ‘bazel-coverage’ command), the package will display code coverage status in
;; buffers that visit instrumented files, using the faces ‘bazel-covered-line’
;; and ‘bazel-uncovered-line’ for covered and uncovered lines, respectively.
